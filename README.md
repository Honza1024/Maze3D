# Maze3D
Something beetween DOOM and Maze (rendering technique is actually closest to Wolfenstein). Simple raycaster in python.
controls: mouse, WASD - move, E - pick up objects, R - reload, LMB - shoot, RMB - switch weapons
demo is now set as default game mode, after killing the giant (huge pinkish creature) there is no more gameplay
open settings.py and tweak values for better game experience
